# Tool Refactoring Status

## Completed (Hybrid Architecture)
- ✅ **context.py** - Full hybrid support (AIDA, PydanticAI, MCP, OpenTelemetry)
- ✅ **execution.py** - Full hybrid support
- ✅ **files.py** - Full hybrid support  
- ✅ **system.py** - Full hybrid support
- ✅ **llm_response.py** - New tool for direct LLM responses

## Temporarily Disabled (To Meet Deadline)
- ❌ **thinking.py** - Not refactored, disabled
- ❌ **maintenance.py** - Not refactored, disabled
- ❌ **project.py** - Not refactored, disabled
- ❌ **architecture.py** - Not refactored, disabled

## Critical Fix Implemented
Fixed issue where general knowledge questions were incorrectly using file_operations tool:
1. Created new `llm_response` tool for direct LLM answers
2. Updated orchestrator prompt to guide proper tool selection
3. Removed non-refactored tools to reduce complexity

## To Re-enable Disabled Tools
1. Refactor each tool to hybrid architecture pattern
2. Uncomment imports in `aida/tools/__init__.py`
3. Add back to `initialize_default_tools()` in `base.py`
4. Test thoroughly
