# Tool Refactoring Status

## Completed (Modular Architecture + Hybrid)
- ✅ **thinking/** - Full modular pattern with hybrid support
- ✅ **llm_response/** - Full modular pattern with hybrid support

## Completed (Hybrid Architecture - Single File)
- ⚠️ **context.py** - Full hybrid support but needs modular refactoring (1,307 lines)
- ⚠️ **execution.py** - Full hybrid support but needs modular refactoring (908 lines)
- ⚠️ **files.py** - Full hybrid support but needs modular refactoring (842 lines)
- ⚠️ **system.py** - Full hybrid support but needs modular refactoring (769 lines)

## Temporarily Disabled (To Meet Deadline)
- ❌ **maintenance.py** - Not refactored, disabled
- ❌ **project.py** - Not refactored, disabled
- ❌ **architecture.py** - Not refactored, disabled

## Critical Fix Implemented
Fixed issue where general knowledge questions were incorrectly using file_operations tool:
1. Created new `llm_response` tool for direct LLM answers
2. Updated orchestrator prompt to guide proper tool selection
3. Removed non-refactored tools to reduce complexity

## To Re-enable Disabled Tools
1. Refactor each tool to hybrid architecture pattern
2. Uncomment imports in `aida/tools/__init__.py`
3. Add back to `initialize_default_tools()` in `base.py`
4. Test thoroughly
